```
If python is not installed on your machine go to the site: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org), download **Python 3.X.X** and follow the instructions. 

If you are Linux user you can install Python from the console with the command : `$ sudo apt-get install python3`

If you are MacOS user you can use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) and install Python from the terminal with the command : `$ sudo port install python3`

Or you can use too [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) from the terminal with the command : `$ brew install python3`
